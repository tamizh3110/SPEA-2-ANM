# SPEA-2-ANM
SPEA-2((Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6672/8d01f9ebd0446ab346a855a44d2b138fd82d.pdf]  provides pareto optimal solutions based on the idea of pareto dominance principle.

SPEA-2 ANM was developed by incorporating anomaly detection techniques within the optimization procedure to improve convergence and diversity potential of the obtained pareto front in comparison to the true pareto front. Results show that SPEA-2 ANM was highly competitive in optimizing test functions in comparison to another well known multi objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-2.
